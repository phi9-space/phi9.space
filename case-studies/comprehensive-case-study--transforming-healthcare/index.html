The statistics paint a concerning picture of the current state:</span></p><p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><span><strong class="font-semibold">Psychiatric Patient Safety Challenges</strong></span></p><p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><span>Patient elopement - the unauthorized departure of patients from healthcare facilities - poses significant risks, particularly in psychiatric and neurological units. Studies show that elopement is more frequently reported in psychiatric units or hospitals, with patients with psychiatric conditions, especially those who are involuntarily admitted, being at highest risk. The implementation of effective elopement risk assessment tools has demonstrated the potential for 50% reduction in elopement incidents, highlighting the critical need for proactive monitoring solutions.[^2][^4]</span></p><p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><span><strong class="font-semibold">Code Blue Emergency Response Inefficiencies</strong></span></p><p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><span>Emergency response times are critical to patient survival, yet current systems show significant room for improvement. Research indicates that Code Blue teams arrive at scenes in an average of 2.83 ± 1.30 minutes, with intervention times for correctly made calls averaging 33.97 ± 17.95 minutes. More alarmingly, only 42.6% of Code Blue calls are made correctly, indicating substantial gaps in emergency identification and response protocols.[^1]</span></p><p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><span><strong class="font-semibold">Neurological Department Vulnerabilities</strong></span></p><p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><span>Neurological patients face unique safety challenges due to their complex conditions and specialized care requirements. Studies show that neurological patients have a high proportion of adverse events in hospital settings, with limitations in emergency department education and access to neurological expertise placing patients at significant risk. The complexity of neurocognitive disorders, combined with high levels of comorbidity, creates challenging environments where medical errors are more likely to occur.[^5][^6][^7]</span></p><h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-primary mt-4 mb-2"><span>Operational Inefficiencies and Staff Burden</span></h3><p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><span><strong class="font-semibold">Equipment Location and Asset Management Crisis</strong></span></p><p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><span>Healthcare staff waste substantial time searching for critical equipment, with nurses spending up to 60 minutes per shift locating necessary devices.
